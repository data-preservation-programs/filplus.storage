#### What is Filecoin+?

Filecoin provides a robust and decentralized platform that anyone can use to store data. Storage providers on the network receive block rewards based on the reliable storage they provide.

In order to maximize the amount of useful storage that Filecoin can support, Filecoin Plus was introduced as a social layer mechanism that incentivizes all participants to make Filecoin more useful. Data owners use a resource, DataCap, to make deals with storage providers who are greatly incentivized to store their data as it increases their share of block rewards over time.

Within the Filecoin Plus program there are different stakeholders that interact through the allocation and spending of DataCap. Root key holders, notaries, data owners, and storage providers all work together to create a governed community.
